Final project for ENEL 645: Data Mining & Machine Learning by David Cooksley, Evan Cooksley, Brendan Mahler, Khoi Nguyen

##Abstract
A common application of neural networks in the medical field
is image segmentation. When interpreting MRI brain images,
using neural networks to segment the image can greatly im-
prove the efficiency of the process, but training these mod-
els can be time consuming and expensive. In the interest
of improving the viability of this process, we investigate the
impacts of using a gender-imbalanced data set on the per-
formance of U-net neural image segmentation models. We
trained multiple models on all female, all male, and a mixed-
gender set of images, and investigated each modelâ€™s perfor-
mance on both male and female test images. Our experiment
found no significant variation in the Dice coefficient scores of
brain segmentation performed by models trained using single
or mixed-gender data sets.
